# GenAI-Study-Assistant
GenAI Study Bot is an AI-powered study assistant built using Python, Streamlit, and the OpenAI API. The application provides an interactive chatbot interface that helps users understand academic concepts, summarize notes, and answer subject-related questions in real time. The project demonstrates API integration, secure key management using Streamlit secrets, and deployment of a lightweight web app using Streamlit. To run the application locally, install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt, create a .streamlit/secrets.toml file containing your OPENAI_API_KEY, and start the app with python -m streamlit run app.py. The app will launch in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
